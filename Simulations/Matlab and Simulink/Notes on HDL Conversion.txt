In the MatLab command window:
--->hdlsetup('NAME OF SIMULINK FILE');  initial setup
--->hdlsetuptoolpath('ToolName', 'FPGA DEVICE NAME', 'ToolPath', 'C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2019.2\bin'); setup to compile to fpga

There is a tool: The fixed-point designer tool.

Note:
I think that we need to download this https://www.mathworks.com/products/hdl-verifier.html and this https://www.mathworks.com/products/hdl-coder.html
To make this work

Also, be sure to use blocks that have the HDL label on them or they will not be able to be ported to the FPGA:
